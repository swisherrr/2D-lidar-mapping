## DESCRIPTION:

A room-mapping system that uses LiDAR sensors to detect and map obstacles in real time. The data from the LiDAR sensors will be processed and displayed in a 2D graphical user interface (GUI), allowing users to see an overhead “map” of the environment as it’s being scanned. This setup can be used for anything from robotics research to facility safety monitoring. 

Initially, the project will operate as a stationary or manually moved platform. In later iterations, it may be motorized to autonomously navigate through a space and continuously update the 2D map. The target audience includes robotics students, engineers, hobbyists, and organizations looking for affordable and adaptable indoor mapping solutions.

## TECHNOLOGY:

Hardware: LiDAR sensors, microcontrollers, motors, and 3D printer.
Software: C/C++, Python, embedded networking.

## TO USE:

EXAMPLE: Download .zip including C and Python files. Run files.
